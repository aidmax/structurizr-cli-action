# structurizr-cli GitHub Action

This GitHub action allows you to run [structurizr-cli](https://github.com/structurizr/cli), a command line utility for [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) that lets you create software architecture models based upon the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) using a textual [domain specific language (DSL)](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl).

Currently, the action supports the following functionality:

- __Push__ content to a Structurizr workspace (the cloud service or an on-premises installation)
- __Pull__ content from Structurizr (the cloud service or an on-premises installation)
  - A model and views defined using the [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl)
  - Markdown/AsciiDoc documentation
  - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Usage

To use the action simply create an `structurizr-cli.yml` (or choose custom `*.yml` name) in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

For example:

```yaml
